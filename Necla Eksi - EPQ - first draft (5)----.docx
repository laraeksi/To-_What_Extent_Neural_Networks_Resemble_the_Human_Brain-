Since the dawn of human imagination, the quest to create thinking machines has persisted across civilizations. From the mythical craftsmen of ancient Greece to the early pioneers of programmable computers, the dream of machine intelligence has evolved. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is not just a dream but a dynamic reality permeating our daily lives, automating tasks and advancing scientific frontiers. The narrative of AI, however, encountered a critical juncture as it transitioned from rule-based problem-solving to addressing nuanced challenges that demand intuitive understanding.(Ian Goodfellow et al., 2016) 
This essay embarks on an exploration of a transformative solution to these challenges—deep learning. Unlike traditional AI successes in controlled environments, deep learning empowers computers to learn experientially, unravelling the world through hierarchical layers of concepts. The resulting interconnected graph of concepts, deep and layered, gives birth to the term "deep learning." Bridging the gap between formalised tasks and the informal complexities of human-centric activities requires capturing intuitive knowledge—a task traditional approaches struggled to accomplish.(Abiodun et al., 2018) 
As we delve into the evolution of AI, this essay navigates through the realms of machine learning, where computers acquire knowledge by discerning patterns from raw data. With algorithms like logistic regression and naive Bayes, machine learning enables computers to make subjective decisions and tackle real-world problems. The narrative emphasises the pivotal role of data representation, illustrating how the effectiveness of machine learning hinges on representing features aptly. This journey traverses the historical pursuit of intelligent machines, the challenges in formalising human intuition, and the transformative roles of deep learning and machine learning in realising the dream of machines that comprehend the complexities of our intricate world.(Prof Thore Graepel, 2020) 

Understanding AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning:
Imagine a future where technology has unlocked the secrets of our brains, allowing us to experience tailored satisfaction without the need for physical structures. This utopian vision relies on the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) with human biology. While AI has long been associated with problem-solving, its application to understand and enhance human biology is a burgeoning reality.(Prof Thore Graepel, 2020)


AI Defined:
AI is a technological paradigm rooted in human biology, where computational systems mimic human behaviour. It has witnessed remarkable success in problem-solving, even conquering challenges deemed unsolvable a decade ago. From generating realistic images and environments to autonomously synthesising content from natural language, AI showcases its prowess in diverse domains.(Alexander Amini, 2023) 
Machine Learning Unveiled:
Within the expansive landscape of AI, machine learning emerges as a pivotal subset. This discipline empowers computers to acquire knowledge by discerning patterns from raw data, enabling them to make subjective decisions. Algorithms like logistic regression and naive Bayes exemplify the capability of machine learning to address real-world problems. (Alexander Amini, 2023)
Deep Learning's Hierarchical Insight:
Deep learning, which falls under the broader category of machine learning, explores the complexities and intricacies of neural networks. These networks, mirroring the functional similarities between human brain neurons and AI neural networks, extract intricate features and patterns from data. By creating hierarchical layers of concepts, deep learning enables computers to learn experientially, a paradigm shift from explicit rule-based problem-solving.(Ian Goodfellow et al., 2016) 
In essence, AI, machine learning, and deep learning collectively form the trajectory of our technological evolution, with each layer building upon the other. The future promises not just data processing but a profound understanding of our complex world, bridging the realms of artificial and human intelligence. The ensuing exploration will elucidate how these technologies may unravel the mysteries of the human brain and shape a future where the boundaries of what we can achieve are continually pushed.(Han et al., 2018) 
Simplifying the Process of Teaching Computers:
The process of instructing computers to perform various tasks using raw data involves three key elements: big data (easy to collect and store), massively parallelizable hardware (like Graphics Processing Units-GPUs), and improved software techniques (new models of Toolboxes). Let's break down this complex process, starting with the fundamental unit—the perceptron.(Han et al., 2018)
Understanding Perceptrons:
A perceptron is the basic building block of a neural network, and to comprehend its function, let's visualise it with a picture and refer to a simple chart and formula. In a perceptron, it takes M different inputs (numbered 1 to M) and associates each input with a weight. These inputs are then multiplied by their corresponding weights. The resulting products, along with a bias, are added together, producing a single numerical result. This result is then passed through a non-linear activation function.(Han et al., 2018)


Breaking Down the Process:
1. Input Handling:
  - The inputs (X1 to XM) and weights (W1 to WM) can be represented as vectors (large lists) X and W.
 - These vectors undergo matrix multiplication, a mathematical operation that simplifies the computation.
- The product is added to the bias using matrix addition.(Alexander Amini, 2023) 



2. Activation Function:
   - The summed result goes through a non-linear activation function.
  - If the activation function is triggered (activated), the resulting value is sent to the next perceptron.(Patrick H. Wilton, 2016) 

By breaking down the process into these steps, we can understand how a neural network processes information. The combination of inputs, weights, and biases, followed by the application of non-linear activation, forms the foundation of a perceptron's functionality. This understanding serves as the basis for more intricate neural network structures and the broader field of machine learning.(Han et al., 2018) 

 
Understanding Neural Networks:
The term "neural network" is derived from its inspiration—the neurons in the human brain. Initially, there was optimism about the potential of neural networks to solve problems due to their similarity to the human brain. However, this hope dwindled as models created before 2010 showed little promise. The turning point came in 2012 when Jeff Hinton from the University of Toronto introduced a groundbreaking model with 60 million parameters, capable of recognizing 1000 categories. This achievement marked a significant success in classification and reignited enthusiasm for neural networks.(Han et al., 2018)
Neural networks remain powerful yet enigmatic tools in data mining. While they demonstrate exceptional modelling performance, their opaque models hinder comprehensive understanding. In this methodology aimed at elucidating the classifications made by multilayer perceptrons. The concept of "causal importance" is proposed, accompanied by a saliency metric for selecting pertinent variables. Following the model's training using pertinent variables, it forms clusters based on the representation in the hidden layer. By applying saliency and causal significance to each cluster, understanding the workings of the neural network classifier becomes easier. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated on three benchmark datasets.(Abiodun et al., 2018) 
Neural network techniques are widely acknowledged for their modelling prowess, yet their lack of interpretability hinders wider adoption. Beyond constructing effective classifiers, understanding the reasons behind individual classifications is crucial. This paper introduces the concept of "causal importance," extending the analysis to a set of individuals and enabling interpretation of the classification. A saliency metric, derived from the neural network trained with all inputs, aids in variable elimination for efficient modelling. The interpretation is conducted at both global and individual levels, emphasising scalability through clustering analysis in the factor space. The paper establishes a framework involving neural network training, variable selection, and cluster-based interpretation to enhance the practicality of data mining processes.(Patrick H. Wilton, 2016) 


Section snippets:
Motivation and Previous Works:
Addressing the question of how an individual would be affected by changes in variables post-classifier construction, the paper proposes a visual analysis based on the multilayer perceptron's input-output mapping. Previous attempts at interpreting neural network classifications involved clustering examples using rules mimicking model outputs, with decision trees being a popular tool in this context.(Alexander Amini, 2023) 

The Datasets:
The methodology is validated on three benchmark datasets: Congressional voting dataset, Heart disease dataset, and another undisclosed dataset. The proposed approach is assessed for accuracy and effectiveness in simplifying neural networks.The saliency measurement, applicable to uncorrelated input variables, proves effective in simplifying neural networks. The proposed clustering algorithm, coupled with graphical analysis of causal importance, facilitates interpretation without compromising classification performance. The study's broader contributions lie in enhancing the interpretability of neural network classifications within a practical data mining framework.(Han et al., 2018) 

Simulating Neuronal Processes:
To grasp the functioning of a neural network, envision the simulation of processes that occur in human neurons. When the axon, a part of the neuron, is simulated, it releases vesicles into the inner synaptic gaps between adjacent neurons. If the sum of these simulations reaches a critical level, a spike—a form of transmission—travels down the axon. Following this event, the neuron enters a quiet phase, known as the refractory period, during which it recovers its strength. Neurons operate on an "all or none" principle—either firing or not firing, creating a situation akin to an all-or-nothing scenario.(Patrick H. Wilton, 2016) 
Unveiling the Synergy: Neural Networks and Neuroscience
	Neuroscience, which is one of the branches of science that benefits most from the similarities of these two structures today, tries to analyse and analyse the structure of the brain using the neural network structure. These studies actually begin with the emergence of the neural network structure, neural network was created in 1943 by neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts. It emerged to examine the structure of neurons in the brain. This structure, which did not achieve much success in the following years, fell into silence and despair until the neural network model made by Geoffrey Hinton achieved a high degree of success in 2012. After this exploration, neural networks made a great contribution not only to the field of computers but also to neuroscience.(Abiodun et al., 2018) 
Real-Time Neural Network Solutions in Neuroscience
Neuroscientists have effectively reduced the delay between a variation in brain activity and the display of the related neurofeedback signal by 50 times.The research introduces the challenge of isolating a specific brain rhythm from broad-band EEG data to estimate its instantaneous phase and amplitude, referred to as the envelope. This is achieved by filtering the EEG time series to obtain a complex-valued narrow-band analytic signal corresponding to the target rhythm. The analytic signal provides access to instantaneous envelopes and phase time series.(Semenkov et al., 2023) 
However, the process of isolating the narrow-band component incurs fundamental delays due to the Gabor uncertainty principle. To address this, the study reviews a solution proposed earlier that separates filtering and forecasting tasks, using an auto-regressive model for the latter. It also discusses compensation methods, such as Kalman filtering (KF), that utilise a state-space model to convey additional information and enhance phase tracking performance.(Semenkov et al., 2023)
The research proposes a novel approach using modern neural networks (NNs) for low-latency extraction of brain rhythmic activity. The NN-based solution operates in real-time, with a pipeline involving low-latency filtering to estimate the analytic signal, from which envelope and phase estimates are derived. The proposed approach aims to reduce delays and improve accuracy compared to traditional methods.(Semenkov et al., 2023) 
The study emphasises the utility of NNs in this context, presenting a real-time pipeline for applications like neurofeedback (NFB), state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). The goal is to provide a more accurate and nearly zero-latency tracking of brain oscillatory activity parameters, contributing to the emerging field of closed-loop neuroscience. All data and code used in the research are made publicly available for further exploration.(Semenkov et al., 2023) 
In this research, the authors investigated the use of neural network (NN) architectures for low-latency filtering and estimation of envelope and phase of brain rhythms. Unlike traditional time series forecasting tasks, the focus here was on isolating the signal of interest in a specific frequency band and forecasting it to compensate for the inherent delay in narrow-band filtering. The researchers compared various NN architectures for accuracy in capturing EEG signal patterns and found that a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) outperformed others in accurately predicting synthetic signals for a 100ms horizon with fewer parameters.(Semenkov et al., 2023)
The TCN-based solution for low-latency filtering was further tested on both synthetic and real EEG data, along with a more complex Conv-TasNet NN. The TCN model exhibited superior accuracy in phase and envelope estimates, operating at the lowest latency, even when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The researchers observed that the TCN and Conv-TasNet solutions were tolerant to decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while maintaining high accuracy.(Semenkov et al., 2023)
Despite the need for fine-tuning for individual subjects, the TCN model outperformed the larger Conv-TasNet in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The study emphasised the importance of real-time EEG processing for applications like neurofeedback (NFB) technology and closed-loop paradigms. The research proposed addressing delays in brain activity feature extraction for establishing natural communication with brain circuits.(Semenkov et al., 2023)
Looking ahead, the authors suggested that advancements in efficient real-time EEG processing algorithms, running directly on EEG devices, could contribute to creating artificial feedback loops integrated seamlessly into the brain's circuitry. The ultimate goal is to leverage neuroplasticity mechanisms for bidirectional communication with the brain's neural networks, paving the way for exciting developments in brain-machine interfaces and control over brain circuits.(Tang et al., 2023) 
Neural Networks in Brain-Machine Interfaces: The Neuralink Paradigm
Another research NeuraLink, one of the largest studies, aimed to analyse the brain, it has not achieved clearer success, but it still has a great potential for the future. It  explores the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications, with a focus on Elon Musk's Neuralink project. AI involves creating intelligent technologies that can perform tasks requiring human understanding, such as natural language interpretation, voice recognition, and machine vision. Musk's Neuralink is a brain-machine interface that aims to treat various medical conditions, including paralysis, anxiety, and addiction, by implanting fine wires into the brain.(Sindhusha, 2021)  
The research draws a comparison between Neuralink's employment of a polymer known as Pedot and Inbrain's graphene-based brain implant, arguing that Pedot decomposes too quickly in the brain to maintain long-term stability.Elon Musk envisions widespread neurosurgery for everyone to receive a Neuralink brain implant, suggesting its potential to enable telepathy, interaction with artificial intelligence, and the treatment of brain-based disorders.(Sindhusha, 2021)
While Neuralink has developed a system of fine wires to minimise damage to the brain, achieving Musk's ambitious goals requires a deeper understanding of the brain's functioning. The article points out that the brain is still an enigma, and the physiological elements of anxiety and addiction remain undiscovered.The Verge Science video explores Neuralink's potential and highlights areas that necessitate further research. Musk, known for collaborating with experts in various fields through companies like Tesla and SpaceX, has a history of bringing advanced technologies out of university labs and into practical applications.(Sindhusha, 2021)
Apart from studies, the one that caught my attention the most is Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings.(Sindhusha, 2021)
Breaking Boundaries with Non-Invasive Neural Network Language Decoders
The quest for an advanced brain–computer interface (BCI) capable of decoding continuous language from non-invasive recordings has garnered significant interest due to its potential scientific and practical applications. Presently, non-invasive language decoding tools are confined to identifying stimuli from a limited selection of words or expressions. Addressing this limitation, a groundbreaking non-invasive decoder has been introduced, utilising cortical semantic representations obtained through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This decoder demonstrates the ability to reconstruct continuous language, encompassing perceived speech, imagined speech, and even silent videos, presenting a versatile solution for various tasks.(Tang et al., 2023) 
In contrast to previous BCIs requiring invasive procedures, such as intracranial recordings, this non-invasive decoder marks a significant advancement. It stands poised to be more widely adopted, offering potential applications in both restorative and augmentative contexts. Although non-invasive brain recordings are capable of capturing a wide range of language information, past efforts have been limited to recognizing outputs from a restricted array of options.The novel decoder presented here overcomes these challenges, promising the viability of non-invasive language BCIs.(Tang et al., 2023) 
The novelty of the decoder is its ability to recreate perceived or imagined stimuli by using continuous natural language derived from non-invasive fMRI recordings. However, the endeavour faced a formidable obstacle—the slow temporal resolution of fMRI, characterised by the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal's sluggish response. To decode continuous language, the decoder tackles the ill-posed inverse problem by generating candidate word sequences, evaluating their likelihood of evoking recorded brain responses, and selecting the optimal candidate.(Tang et al., 2023) 
To validate word sequences against brain responses, an encoding model was employed, predicting how the subject's brain reacts to natural language. Brain responses were recorded during extensive exposure to narrative stories, facilitating robust training of the encoding model. The model, which relies on semantic features that encapsulate the essence of the stimulus phrases, employs linear regression to illustrate the impact of these features on brain responses. The encoding model's accuracy in predicting the subject's brain responses to any given word sequence forms the basis for evaluating the likelihood of the sequence evoking recorded brain activity.(Tang et al., 2023)
This innovative approach showcases the potential of non-invasive language BCIs, paving the way for future advancements in decoding continuous language from neural activity, while also emphasising the importance of subject cooperation in both training and application of the decoder to ensure mental privacy.(Tang et al., 2023)
 This research involved recording brain activity through BOLD fMRI as three participants listened to 16 hours of narrated stories. For each subject, an encoding model was developed to forecast brain reactions based on the semantic attributes of the stimulus words. The decoder, in reconstructing language from fresh brain recordings, keeps a collection of potential word sequences. As new words emerge, a language model suggests subsequent words, and the encoding model evaluates the probability of brain responses for each of these continuations. The continuations deemed most probable are then kept. The decoders were tested on single-trial brain responses during subjects listening to test stories not used in model training, and results show accurate  reproduction of words and phrases, capturing the overall meaning.(Tang et al., 2023) 
The decoder's predictions for a test story showed a notably higher resemblance to the real stimulus words than what would be anticipated randomly, as evaluated using different language similarity metrics. The findings, represented as standard deviations above the mean of the null distribution, uniformly indicated statistical significance (* denotes q(FDR) < 0.05 for all subjects). In terms of the BERTScore metric, the decoding scores were substantially above chance level for most timepoints. Furthermore, for one participant, the accuracy of identification, gauged by the congruence between predicted and actual stimuli, was significantly greater than what random chance would suggest.(Semenkov et al., 2023) 
The research utilises BOLD fMRI responses to measure how well recorded brain responses align with predicted responses A generative neural network language model, which has been trained on sequences of natural English, is used to pinpoint probable stimulus words.Despite the vast number of possible word sequences, a beam search algorithm efficiently narrows down candidate sequences by maintaining the most likely ones. The decoders, trained for three subjects, accurately captured the meaning of stimuli, demonstrating the recovery of fine-grained semantic information from the BOLD signal. Performance metrics, including BERTScore, revealed decoding success above chance, supporting the method's effectiveness.(Semenkov et al., 2023)
Further analysis focused on decoding across different cortical regions. Results indicated that multiple regions represent language at the granularity of individual words and phrases. Consistency in engagement throughout stimuli was observed in the association and prefrontal regions. The study also explored the relationship between language representations in different regions, revealing a redundancy in word-level language representations across various cortical regions. This research contributes valuable insights into understanding how language is represented in the brain and has practical implications for future advancements in brain–computer interfaces.(Wang et al., 2020) 
The research indicates a significant potential for neural networks (NNs) to revolutionise the field of neuroscience, particularly in understanding and interacting with brain activity. One study demonstrates the successful application of NNs for low-latency extraction of brain rhythmic activity. By using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), the researchers achieved superior accuracy in phase and envelope estimates compared to traditional methods. The NN-based solution showed efficiency and tolerance to decreased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), emphasising its importance in real-time EEG processing for applications like neurofeedback technology and closed-loop paradigms.(Semenkov et al., 2023) 
In Elon Musk's Neuralink project, the potential of NNs is highlighted as part of a brain-machine interface. Despite challenges with materials like Pedot, Musk envisions widespread neurosurgery for Neuralink brain implants, suggesting applications for treating paralysis, anxiety, and addiction. Neuralink's system of fine wires minimises damage to the brain, but Musk's ambitious goals, such as enabling telepathy and interaction with artificial intelligence, require deeper insights into brain functioning.(Sindhusha, 2021) 
Another notable study explores a groundbreaking non-invasive decoder for continuous language from brain recordings. The decoder, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and NNs, demonstrates the ability to reconstruct perceived and imagined speech, offering a versatile solution for various tasks. While facing challenges related to the slow temporal resolution of fMRI, the decoder successfully addresses the ill-posed inverse problem, showcasing the potential of non-invasive language brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). This innovation opens avenues for future advancements in understanding and decoding continuous language from neural activity, emphasising the importance of subject cooperation for mental privacy.(Wang et al., 2020)
